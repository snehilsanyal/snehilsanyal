### Future
- No one knows the Future, we go where our tendencies take us, tendencies create desires, what we like we strive for it, planning out and making efforts are crucial. Sometimes, it is frustrating as you donot have proper support and resources, but if its important you will do it no matter what and learn from it. And maybe in coming years, everything that you dreamt and desired about will be achieved (Maybe... Surely ;) )
